# Password Generator

If you want to increase security as a small-business owner, desire to protect your personal/family data, or want to provide an additional layer of protection over your corporations sensitive data, a standard static password may be inadequate. Using a password generator can complement your existing digital security strategy.

A password generator is an application designed to randomize a password based on user-selected criteria. The user selects how many characters they want their password to be by entering that number into the text box. If the user does not select a number between 8 and 128 characters in length the message will reappear until a number is entered. The user will then have the option for their password to have uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or symbols. If there is no option selected the options will loop until one is chosen. Once the password criteria has been chosen by the user, a password will be generated in the box. 

Utilizing randomly generated passwords can help create a secure platform for your needs. The password generator is a secure and efficient cost-effective tool that can be customized to your liking.
